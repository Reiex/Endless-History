Endless-History is the final game I made before entering engineering school. It is a short 2D RPG inspired by The Legend of Zelda: A link to the past. For this game, the goal was to have a real complete game with everything that does a game : A story, game mechanics, acceptable graphics (even though it's still made with Paint) for someone that isn't an artist. To achieve this, I developped a real little game engine with Python3 and [PySFML](https://github.com/intjelic/python-sfml) that can load quests written in XML files, a lot of maps using PNG files (each pixel representing a "tile" on the map), with a system for connecting maps together using "doors", real pathfinding for monsters, etc.

Here's a picture of the game (it's still made with Paint but almost acceptable !):
